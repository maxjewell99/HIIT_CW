# updates and checkpoints 

## checkpoints

* trying to display the name of the workout onto the button for custom workout selection 

* once the user has entered the name of the workout the input field should disappear
    * current issue is that if you enter the name with the activity then add a new activity it will take the name of that input, but you have already entered the name you want in the first submission meaning the name just gets updated to blank.
