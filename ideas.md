# Ideas and Features to add

## OOP
Use getters and setters to make code easier

get workout() {
    return {
        ...do whatever 
    }
}


## Web Components 
Use them at some point


## Key pointers

* ~~remove center ~~
* ~~remove head and body~~
* use id instead of onclick
* use add event listener instead
* avoid innerHTML
* make sure to remove console logs upon submission
* use data-id instead of id as much as you can to avoid clashes


## Progression
* create timer and activity name, description etc in timer section
* timers and activiy name/description to be displayed in custom workout section
* have a save button in the custom workout section and save that to db
* display in section below
* use the simple message board for advice on editing workouts etc
* use grid for layout or displat block and margin auto
